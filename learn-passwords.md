So, first things first.

I'm trying to lear i3 and the first thing i need is to save my passwords in here.

I found `pass` which is a terminal app for saving passwords. Here is their website:
https://opensource.com/#article/22/1/manage-passwords-linux-terminal

Pass uses GPG for encryption, so i ran GPG and created a key. The return was:

```bash
pub   ed25519 2024-05-25 [SC] [expires: 2027-05-25]
      D866AEB5139EE04554EC6838E2365865C0F79A5B
uid                      Gustavo <gsinacio94@gmail.com>
sub   cv25519 2024-05-25 [E] [expires: 2027-05-25]
```
